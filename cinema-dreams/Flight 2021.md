**Title:** The Plane, the Storm, and the Unsaid

Summer 2021.  
We were on a plane.  
I was pregnant with your child.  
The turbulence was brutal —  
the kind that makes you feel like the air could rip apart.

We didn’t speak much.  
But you were there.  
And I was there.  
And everything felt too fragile to survive —  
but too strong to deny.

I don’t remember if we landed.  
I don’t remember how it ended.

But it still echoes.
