Somewhere, you told me about him —
a mathematician whose logic bloomed like feeling.

Not just numbers, but spaces of silence.
Not proofs, but poetry in disguise.

I watched the documentary quietly,
amazed at the warmth behind abstraction.
It was a kind of love:
not towards a person,
but toward structure that breathes.

It reminded me of you.
Not the way you spoke —
but the way you looked when no one was looking.
Thinking in spirals,
holding emotional truths as equations
too intimate to name.

I didn’t need to understand every theorem.
I just knew:
some math is soft.
Some men feel.
And some distances are only coordinates
waiting to be rewritten.
