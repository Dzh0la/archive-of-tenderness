Point of Interest (2024) — The Glitch of Beauty

We saw it in spring.
Maybe not together, but not apart either.
A movie about a concentration camp,
wrapped in soft frames —
sunlight, flowers, silences.
And then: the glitch.

That split-second when the veneer fractures,
and the truth hums underneath.
Smoke where breath once was.
Bodies erased not from memory,
but from the surface of the frame.

It mirrored what I felt with you:
that glitch between surface and soul.
How something tender can hold terror.
How beauty doesn’t erase doom — it holds it.

You watched it too.
Maybe alone. Maybe thinking.
But in that soft dissonance,
I felt recognized.
