# Mizoguchi — Geisha

**Watched at night. Quiet, restrained, but piercing.  
A woman’s life folding in on itself — silently.  
And yet the form holds.**

Fima had once liked this film.  
And I see why.  
It’s all about interiority. About endurance without spectacle.  
About how the world doesn’t break you — you just stop speaking.

I watched it late,  
and it stayed with me the whole night —  
as if someone had laid a soft cloth over the sharp edges inside.

*A cinema of stillness.  
Not absence — but unscreamed feeling.*
