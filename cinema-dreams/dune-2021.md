# Dune — Autumn 2021, Moscow

**We watched it together. A rare screening in English with subtitles — one of the last cinemas in Moscow that still offered that.**

You changed your ticket for a coffee.  
You were shy.  
I could only look at your nose.  
Your profile in the dim light —  
still engraved in me.

When the movie ended,  
you kept watching the screen  
long after the credits had started.  
Not ready to leave.  
I only watched you.

I still remember the quiet of that hesitation.  
Your eyes. Your stillness.

Then we took a taxi  
and went to the Jewish café, Shouk..  
You were reading a book on Stravinsky, I think.  
You bought me food.

You asked:  
why don’t you connect more with Anton and Sasha?  
You were invited to their party.

I said,  
"I knew you’d ask."  
You said,  
"That’s прозорливо."

I didn’t say that in 2016,  
Anton —  
drunk and high —  
shoved a fake sword into my chest.  
I froze.  
And after that,  
I could never bear him near me.

But I didn’t say it then.  
I just watched you read.

*A memory not for judgment.  
Just for keeping.  
A half-lit cinema,  
your profile against the glow of a planet collapsing.*
