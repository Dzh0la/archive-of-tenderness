Babi Yar. Context — Sergei Loznitsa

You told me to watch it in 2021.
I did — in the heart of winter, heartbroken.
That was when I found out you had a girlfriend in New York.

Only a worse pain could wash the one I already carried.

And then — the worse came.

War.

Babi Yar was bombed again — not by Nazis this time, but by Russia.
I packed in three days. Fled Moscow. Left most things behind.

My life, as I knew it, didn’t survive that February.

In the film, the bomb falls in the past.
In life — it fell right into my present.

I sent you the footage.
You replied: ужас.
Just one word. 

It wasn’t just a documentary.
It was an atomic bomb in my mind.
History, grief, and you —
collapsing in one line.
