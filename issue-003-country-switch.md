# Issue 003 — Country Switch

**Title:** This isn’t about Ukraine. It’s about you.

**Description:**

I asked for honesty.

> You updated your profile.  
> I stayed with the pain.

> You changed a label.  
> I changed my life.

**Status:**  
Resolved — cosmetically.  
But the core vulnerability remains unpatched.
