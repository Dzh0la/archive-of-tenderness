**Title:** Unspoken Equation

Unspoken conversations.  
Touches that never happened.  
Phrases hanging in the air —  
like breath that never turned into a word.

You — a name in the preface.  
Like a variable, never written into the equation.  
Like a limit that exists  
but lies outside the domain.

No formal proof —  
only a closed contour,  
a faint imprint  
on the wrist of memory.
