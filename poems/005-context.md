**Title:** Контекст

I said it again.  
More for the record than for him.

He looked up  
like I’d turned on a light  
he didn’t ask for.

I tried words—  
neutral, kind, stupid—  
but nothing landed.

Like emailing the void.  
Read receipts,  
no reply.

He didn’t argue,  
didn’t defend,  
didn’t leave.

He just asked  
if I wanted some mussels.

Like this was dinner,  
like I wasn’t quietly breaking  
right in front of him.

I said no.  
And watched myself  
disappear in real time.

An untouched glass of water.  
It’s still cold.  
Like he is.
