## Letters / Notes / Poems Archive: For Fima

This is a personal archive.  
Not a book. Not a statement. Just a record of what was shared, felt, missed, survived.

These pieces span years — from 2021 to 2024 — and are grouped into:

- `poems/` — written in breath. some soft, some cutting.  
- `notes/` — memories of books, movies, talks. shared or one-sided.  
- `letters/` — what I said, and didn’t say.  
- `readings/` — excerpts and my responses. reading as a dialogue.  
- `cinema-dreams/` — films that mirrored or echoed my inner world.  
- `readings-issue/` — reading-related fragments, tensions, questions that stayed unresolved.

Each page is a splinter — but also a thread.  
If you’re reading this — it means you found your way here. That’s enough.

> Letter 100: If you find this — you know my answer.
