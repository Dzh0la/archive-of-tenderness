Just a breath that wrote itself over four strange, silent years.

## 🧭 Folders

- `poems/` — written in breath. some soft, some cutting.  
- `letters/` — what I said, and didn’t say.  
- `notes/` — fragments of memory, scenes, books, pain, and warmth.  
- `readings/` — things I read that read me back.  
- `cinema-dreams/` — shared movie memory, real and phantom.  
- `readings-issue/` — the unfinished shelf of what I still carry.

If you’re here, you already know why.  




All these words are mine —
not for resale, but for recognition.
You may read, feel, remember —
but don’t copy without credit.
And don’t turn grief into content.
