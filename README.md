Not a book. Not a goodbye.  
Just a breath that wrote itself over four strange, silent years.

## ðŸ§­ Folders

- `poems/` â€” written in breath. some soft, some cutting.  
- `letters/` â€” what I said, and didnâ€™t say.  
- `notes/` â€” fragments of memory, scenes, books, pain, and warmth.  
- `readings/` â€” things I read that read me back.  
- `cinema-dreams/` â€” shared movie memory, real and phantom.  
- `readings-issue/` â€” the unfinished shelf of what I still carry.

If youâ€™re here, you already know why.  
Thereâ€™s no call to action. No apology. No demand.

Just a presence.  
And maybe: a new breath.
