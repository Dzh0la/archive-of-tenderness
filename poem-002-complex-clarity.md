**Title:** Complex Clarity

I don’t know how I would’ve acted in your place.  
I know what you did hurt me — and I also see your fear.  
You felt something. You froze. I moved.  

That doesn’t make you cruel.  
It just makes us both human.

And now — I name it.  
Not to excuse — but to unhook.  
To stay warm in the part of me that kept walking.
