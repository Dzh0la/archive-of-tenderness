**Title:** You went to see Glass — I shattered.

You knew how much I loved Philip Glass.  
And when you saw *Akhnaten* at the MET — while I was alone in Tbilisi,  
switching flats like lifeboats — I broke a little more.

> I was envy, I was jealous, I was in grief.  
> You were in New York. With her. Watching Glass. Not me.

You said: *"I was envy myself."*  
You were shining. I was ashes. And I couldn't tell you how much it burned.  
So I asked for distance. You said: *okay*.  

We didn't speak for half a year.  

Then, New Year came — and I wrote.  
Not because it didn’t hurt anymore —  
but because I learned to breathe through the pain.  

By then, I had new music. New spaces.  
But your silence still echoes in Akhnaten’s chords.
