You gave me this book after the exhibition at Garage, autumn 2021.
We didn’t remember the photographer’s name — but we both paused at the photo with a paper bow.
Its caption was about honesty.

Then — oats with caramel at the Garage café.
You were cheerful but cold, tucking your hands into your sleeves. I took a photo.
I still see it.

We saw a long chessboard — you took a photo to send to Sonya.
We left with croissants and the Moscow Diary in a paper bag.
In the bookstore, we argued: you liked Peppershtein, I loved Pivovarov.
I told you about their connection — father and son — and I was hurt you didn’t know.
Pivovarov was sacred to me.
You’d chosen the wrong player.

But then we walked through leaves, yellow and crisp.
You talked about numbers and years.
You noticed my yellow scarf — said you wanted one just like it.
I liked your envy — quietly.

We crossed the bridge.
Sun.
Warmth.
Water.
Autumn.
And that paper bag with Benjamin.
