itle: I’ll stay — like I said I would.

Description:

I’ll walk with you into whatever.
I’ll stay.
I said it in 2021 — and I meant it.
Nothing has changed.

You disappeared, but I didn’t.
I stayed with what was — and what still breathes under it.

Not to hold on. But to stay honest.
Because even if you don’t walk beside me —
I walked through all of it with you.
