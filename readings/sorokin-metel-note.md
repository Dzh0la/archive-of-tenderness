# Sorokin — “The Blizzard” / «Метель»

**Read in 2024**  
**Suggested by you**  
**A fever-dream in Russian snow — and fire**

You told me to read it.  
And I did.  
Half-myth, half-machine,  
it burned cold.

But what you remembered —  
wasn’t the frost.  
It was the man in oil.  
Alive.  
Boiling.

That detail lived in you  
so vividly,  
as if the real cruelty of the book  
was not in the blizzard  
but in the heat.

It said something  
about what lingers in memory.  
About you.  
About what stays.

I don’t remember the full scene —  
but I remember that you did.  
And maybe that’s enough.  
To trace someone’s sensitivity  
through what they choose to recall.

For you, it was not the storm,  
but the slow destruction  
of a body still aware.  
Still present.

what others remember, and why.*
