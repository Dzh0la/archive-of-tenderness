# Issue 002 — Trace Error

**Title:** If I had died — you wouldn’t block me.

**Description:**
This is not a heartbreak. This is post-mortem clarity.
You didn’t disappear. You severed.
Every block, every silence — was a glitch in your courage, not in my worth.

> You wanted to erase me like a runtime error.  
> But I debugged you — to find myself.
