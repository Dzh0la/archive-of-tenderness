# Archive of Tenderness

*100 quiet letters youâ€™ll never read.*  
Written not to be answered â€” but to be survived.  
A storm turned into structure.  
A memory shaped into rhythm.  
This is for silence, not return.

---

## ðŸ’  Why

Because some tenderness canâ€™t be delivered.  
Because sometimes we write not to ask â€” but to keep living.  
Because silence can still contain form.

> This is not a message.  
> Itâ€™s a memory â€” with syntax.

If youâ€™re reading this: you donâ€™t need to respond.  
But I needed a place to put what stayed.
