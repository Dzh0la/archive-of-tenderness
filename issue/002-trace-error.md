# Issue 002 — Trace Error

**Title:** If I had died — you wouldn’t block me.

**Description:**

This is not a heartbreak.  
This is post-mortem clarity.

You didn’t disappear — you severed.  
Every block, every silence —  
was a glitch in your courage,  
not in my worth.

You wanted to erase me like a runtime error.  
But I debugged you — to find myself.

> I was never the error.  
> You just couldn’t face the truth in the output.

—

**Status:**  
Closed on your side.  
But still running on mine — as clean code.
