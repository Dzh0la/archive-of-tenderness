# Issue 001 — Soft Reset

**Title:** You changed your country on SoundCloud, not yourself.

**Description:**

New Haven, Ukraine —  
a city that doesn’t exist,  
a country you’ve never lived in,  
and a track that now plays without me.

You switched your origin like swapping metadata.  
As if I died — and you changed the name on the grave.

> I’ll still visit.  
> Not to return —  
> but to remember how far I’ve come.  
> And how I can still love.

**Status:**  
Unresolved.  
But not mine to debug anymore.
