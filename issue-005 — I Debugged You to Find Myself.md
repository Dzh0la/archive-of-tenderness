# Issue 005 — I Debugged You to Find Myself

**Title:** I Debugged You to Find Myself

**Description:**

And somewhere in the logs,  
I found my voice.

Not revenge — clarity.  
Not shadow — syntax.  

You treated my presence like a malfunction.  
But I was the only one tracing the real error.

> You thought you deleted me.  
> I turned it into documentation.

—

**Status:**  
Resolved — by becoming real.
