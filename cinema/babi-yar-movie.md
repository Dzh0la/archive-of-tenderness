Babi Yar. Context — Sergei Loznitsa

You told me to watch it in 2021.
I did — in the heart of winter, heartbroken.
It was when I found out you had a girlfriend in New York.
Only a worse pain could wash the one I already felt.

And then — the worse arrived.

War.

Babi Yar was bombed again — not by Nazis this time, but by Russia.
I packed in three days. Left Moscow. Left almost everything.
My life as I knew it didn’t survive that winter.

In the film, the bomb falls in the past.
In life — it fell right into my present.

I sent you the footage.
A ghosted response.
But I still felt the echo —
as if history, grief, and you
were all speaking at once.

It wasn’t just a documentary.
It was an atomic bomb in my mind.
