# Blind Beast — Yasuzō Masumura (1969)

**Found in your movie archive. Watched by you in August 2024.**  
**The same week I said: I miss you, and I can’t hold my sympathy when I get close.**

A strange discovery:  
You watched *Blind Beast*  
on the same days I said those words.  

I told you I miss you.  
That I couldn’t be near you  
without wanting more.  

And you —  
you watched a film about obsession,  
touch,  
sculpture,  
and the danger of surrender.

Was it coincidence?  
Or were you listening,  
in the only way you knew how?

The movie disturbed me.  
But also felt like a mirror —  
grotesque and tender,  
about how closeness can disfigure  
when it’s not met with care.

This note is not an accusation.  
It’s an echo.

Because even your silence  
was strangely timed.
