# Jeanne Dielman — January 2024

**Watched alone, January 2024**  
**A film that didn’t show pain — it performed it.**

You recommended it to me  
and I didn’t know it would feel so close.

Jeanne —  
folding, cleaning,  
moving through gestures  
like time was something she had to hold in place.

I felt like her.  
Not because of the kitchen  
or the silences  
but because of the unbearable weight  
of being needed and invisible  
at the same time.

Her stillness wasn’t still.  
It was screaming beneath the surface.  
Like mine.

And I watched her crack —  
not loudly, but precisely.  
Not because she was weak,  
but because the world refused to see her  
until she broke its rhythm.

It was a mirror I didn’t want,  
but needed.

Thank you  
for this recognition,  
this slow unraveling  
that matched mine.
