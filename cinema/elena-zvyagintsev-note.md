# Elena — Zvyagintsev (2021)

**Watched in 2021**  
**Recommended by you**  
**A quiet unraveling. A trigger. A threshold.**

You told me to watch *Elena*.  
I did.  
And something shifted.  

The stillness, the cold interiors,  
the silent cruelty —  
it all felt like the world I feared  
and somehow lived in.  

The film moved me.  
So much so  
that I decided to tell you I liked you.  
Not because of the plot —  
but because of the way you saw the world,  
and how you shared it.

That confession opened something —  
and also broke something.  
I stepped forward.  
You froze.

And from that point,  
everything began to ache.

Not because of *Elena*.  
But because I believed  
you would meet me in that honesty.

*This belongs to the archive of early signals —  
when love begins with admiration,  
and pain begins with a door not opened.*
