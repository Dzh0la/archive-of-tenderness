You never watched it —
but it mattered to you.
Sorokin was sacred.
A figure you carried with reverence.

I watched the documentary in 2021.
Alone — but thinking of you.
It was brilliant, sharp, cold, luminous.
Like the inside of your mind.

Three years later —
we sat at Shuka in New York.
Stephan, his brother, you, and me.
You asked: “How many Sorokin books have you read?”
“Five or six,” I said.
You smiled: “Me too.”

It wasn’t about numbers.
It was the only moment of shared code.
My boyfriend — none.
You — five.
And your brother noticed something in the quiet.

You didn’t need to say it.
Sorokin said it for you.
