I found it on your watched list.
Alongside Blind Beast and Geisha.
The timing stopped my breath.
Because I had just begun to fall —
into a grief you would never name,
and a relationship you didn’t know was hurting me.

In the film,
a woman cuts out her husband’s eyes —
not to kill him,
but to save him.

I couldn’t look away.
I whispered:
did you cut my sight to save my life?

It was cruel. And kind.
A gesture of violence — born of vision.

You were gone.
But you watched this.
