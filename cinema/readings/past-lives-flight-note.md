# Past Lives — Flight Note

**Watched on a flight from Amsterdam to New York, December 2023**  
**With Stefan, somewhere over the Atlantic**

There was something unbearable and soft in it.  
Like watching your own silence on screen.  
The pauses, the ache —  
not in what was said,  
but in what could never be.

New York looked exactly like my insides —  
sharp angles, soft sadness,  
movement without conclusion.

I watched “Past Lives” above the clouds,  
but it felt like I was watching my own past  
try to speak through someone else’s story.

And it didn’t scream.  
It whispered.  
Like the ache that travels with you  
even when you change your country.

I don’t know if it was about Stefan,  
or Fima,  
or me.  
Maybe all of us.  
Maybe the version of me I couldn’t bring here.

But it stayed with me.  
That soft precision.  
That cinematic pain  
of something unresolved —  
but real.
