Title: I didn’t notice — because I was living it.

I didn’t count.
I didn’t archive.
I didn’t name it.

I was just living —
and so were you.

And now, when I look back,
I see it:

Films, theatres, exhibitions —
our calendar of presence.

We didn’t meet often.
But we saw the same things.
In the same years.
And something in me always knew:
you were there.
Even when you weren't.
