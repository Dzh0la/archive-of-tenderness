**Title:** Gravity and Weight — Pynchon, January 2024

You gave me *Gravity’s Rainbow* in January 2024.

I brought a small red poetry book I found in Berlin in 2023 — it had a beautiful Russian letter **F** on the cover. 
I bought it because of you. Your name loops in me for years. 

F. F. F. So I see F — I bring F.

You asked me: *why this book?*  
I said: *guess* — and pointed at the letter.  
You laughed.

And then you gave me Pynchon. Not light. A whole universe in brick form.  
I thought: *we’re flying over the Atlantic and you give me a stone?*  
But it was the most beautiful book I had ever seen.

I later sold it for 3 euros to a girl in Italy on Vinted.  
She liked Anaïs Nin and looked like a philosopher in black.  
I didn’t read it then — I thought you deleted me. 
That you hurt me. That you still had the nerve to gift me a world.

But later I listened. Pynchon was real. Enormous.  
And Nabokov — my love — once taught at the same university.  
So I trusted the gravity of this book, too.

Still, it felt too male, too sexualized, too much for my raw state.  
So I shelved it in the air — a phantom book. Yours. Mine. Heavy and bright.
